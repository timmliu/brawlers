    "slug": "leon",
    "description": "Leon is a Legendary Brawler who can turn invisible for a short time when using his Super. He has medium health and high damage output if the enemy is close. As the blades travel, their damage is reduced. Leon has the fastest movement speed as well (tied with Crow and Mortis). His star power gives him an increased speed when he uses his super."

    "quote": "Crow fires a trio of poisoned daggers. As a Super move he leaps, firing daggers both on jump and on landing!",
    "avatar": "crow.png",
    "slug": "crow",
    "description": "Crow is a Legendary Brawler that can be unlocked in Brawl Boxes. Because he is a legendary brawler, however, he is quite difficult to obtain. Crowâ€™s main attack throws three quick poisoned daggers in front of him that damage enemies on impact and then deal extra damage over time. He has a long range but low health. He moves faster than every other brawler (with the exception of Leon with his star power and Mortis when he is dashing). His star power decreases the damage output of a poisoned brawler by 10% when they get hit."

    "quote": "Carl throws his Pickaxe like a boomerang. His Super is a crazy cart spin that clobbers anyone around him.",
    "avatar": "carl.png",
    "slug": "carl",
    "description": "Carl is a Super Rare Brawler that can be unlocked through Brawl Boxes. He has moderate health and a high damage output. He is notable because when he attacks, he throws his pickaxe like a boomerang, damaging any enemy that it hits while flying forward or on the way back, like a boomerang. Carl cannot attack again until his pickaxe comes back. His Super allows him to spin and move much quicker, dealing damage to anyone he hits. His star power allows his pickaxe to return faster."

    "quote": "Poco fires damaging sound waves at enemies. His Super can heal both Poco himself and his teammates!",
    "avatar": "poco.png",
    "slug": "poco",
    "description": "Poco is a Rare Brawler who is most notable for his Attack's extremely wide spread. He can deal damage to multiple enemies within his wide-spread attack range. Aside from that, his statistics are average; having moderate-high health and low damage output. His Super is unique in that it allows him to heal himself and all allies within its range. His star power heals his allies with his regular attack by 500 health."

    "quote": "Penny shoots bags of coins, damaging the target and anyone standing behind. Her Super is a mortar-style cannon turret!",
    "avatar": "penny.png",
    "slug": "penny",
    "description": "Penny is a Super Rare Brawler who can place a mortar when you use her Super that has medium health, very high damage output and can hit enemies behind walls. Penny herself has medium health and her long-range Attack can hit enemies behind the original target for additional damage. Her star power allows her cannon to shoot out 6 cannonballs randomly upon being destroyed or respawned, doing 1680 damage to all enemies that are hit."

    "slug": "gene",
    "description": "Gene is a Mythic Brawler who has a moderate amount of health and uses a magic lamp to cast his attacks. His Attack can do high damage to a single enemy or less damage to multiple enemies. His Super grabs an enemy and drags them to Gene's location. His Star Power heals his allies for 200 health a second if they are close to his healing radius."

    "quote": "Spike throws cactus grenades that send needles flying, and a show-stopping Super: a field of cactus spines that slows down and damages enemies!",
    "avatar": "spike.png",
    "slug": "spike",
    "description": "Spike is a Legendary Brawler with low health who specializes in dealing with grouped-up enemies. His Attack and Super are both optimal for dealing with multiple enemies at once. His Attack explodes on impact and shoots spikes in all directions which deal damage to enemies they hit, and his Super slows down and deals damage to enemies caught in its area of effect. His Star Power heals himself for 500 health per second when he is in the radius of his super."
